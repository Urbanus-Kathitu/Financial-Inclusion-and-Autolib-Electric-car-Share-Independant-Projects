Dataset 1 tasks us to understand electric car usage. We will work as a Data Scientist for the Autolib electric car-sharing service company that is located in Paris France which successfully deployed a public electric car-sharing program. The program, was initiated by the mayor of Paris, Bertrand Delaone who was searching for another traffic option to complement the cityâ€™s much-acclaimed bike sharing service to investigate a claim about the blue cars from the provided Autolib dataset.

Dataset 2 is based on Financial Inclusion in Eastern Africa and the comparison between 4 countries mainly Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Rwanda. The data scientists aim is to figure out how we can predict which individuals are most likely to have or use a bank accounts in the named countries. The solution will help provide an indication of the state of financial inclusion in the named countries.
